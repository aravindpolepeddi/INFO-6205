From the graph, the equation can be expected to be of the form 

d=a*ln(n)+c

where d is the average Euclidian distance for some experiments
      n is the number of steps taken by the man (m ranges from 5,10,15...100)
      c value can range from -INf to +INf (in this particular case, to is to be of the around 2.5, which raised the graph above origin to value around 2.5)
      a is the multiplying factor(for -ve values of a, graph is seen in the 4th quadrant and +ve value if a, graph is seen in the first quadrant)
